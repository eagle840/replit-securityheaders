# replit-securityheaders

Let me break down how this Security Header Scanner application works:

## Core Purpose:
- The application scans URLs to check for security-related HTTP headers
- It helps identify missing security headers that could make websites vulnerable

## Architecture:
- Frontend: HTML/JavaScript interface in `templates/index.html` and `static/js/main.js`
- Backend: Flask application (`app.py`) with RESTful API endpoints
- Schema validation: `schema.py` defines the expected request format

## Main Components:

#### Backend (app.py):

- `/` route: Serves the main UI
- `/api/scan` endpoint: Accepts POST requests with URLs to scan
- Validates requests against schema
- Makes HTTP requests to check headers
- Processes and returns security header information


#### Frontend:

- Clean UI with a textarea for URLs
- Asynchronous scanning with loading indicators
- Displays results in cards showing:
  - Present security headers (green)
  - Missing headers (red)
  - Error states for failed requests

## Security Headers Checked:

- Strict-Transport-Security
- Content-Security-Policy
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-Frame-Options
- X-XSS-Protection
- And several others

##Deployment:

- Uses Gunicorn as the WSGI server
- Runs on port 5000
- Configured for auto-scaling deployment

The application follows best practices with error handling, input validation, and proper separation of concerns between frontend and backend components.
